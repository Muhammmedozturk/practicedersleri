    //1)when you try to access to varable by using object in inheritance start to look for the variable in the class
    //used in the data type of the object
    //2)when you try to access to method by using object in inheritance start to look for the object in the class
    //   whose constructor was used
    //3) data type of object can be selected from the class or from the parent class
    //4)private class can not be inherited and default class members can be inherited if the child class in the same package
    // with the parent class
    //5)in the fist line of every constructor there is invisible super to call default constructor from the parent class
